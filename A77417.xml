         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yet was the change in Religion greater then now, for then was an utter rejection of the Romiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion firmely eſtabliſhed in the Kingdom, but now the indeavour of the Parliament is only to purge, not change religion, from erronious doctrine crept in, and introduced by the Prelates and from Superſtitious &amp; Idolatrous worſhipp in the excerciſe thereof; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if King and Parliament would but agree, theſe ſadd &amp; bloody diſtempers would ſoone be ended, and the Papiſticall and Malignant party ſoone ſuppreſſed and reduced to due ſubjection and obedience to their Soveraigne and the Lawes and Conſtitutions of the Kingdom, till which be obtained, there is little hope of Peace of Accommodation.</p>
            <p>In the Raign of <hi>E.</hi> 6. many inſurrections were raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Kingdome to the great diſturbance of the Peace thereof, about Religion and that phenix of his time in all the world, in the flower and prime of his youth cut of by private Treaſon, as it was ſtrongly preſumed and ſuggeſted; but the bloody perſecutor raiſed in the raigne of <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> brought this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into as ſadd a condition as now it is, then nothing but fire and faggot made deſtruction of Proteſtants-blood, for the time not parrelleld in any Nation of Chriſtendome.

            <p>The bleeding condition the Realme and Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi> now ſtands in is knowne to all men, and can it be otherwiſe expected but the ſame will befall <hi>England</hi> if theſe diviſions continue, and no reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation be made betweene King and People.</p>
            <p>It is now time for every member of this greate bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy pollitique to ſet to his helping hand, uſe his beſt witts and pollicie to compoſe theſe diſtempers; do not theſe Malignants begin to uſe the ſame cruelty in thoſe places of the Kingdom where they obtaine the Predommence, as the Popiſh Rebells do in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the late example of them at <hi>Ciceſter,</hi> may be a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peece to the other parts of the Kingdome, to ſtand upon their own defence, and not give the leaſt way to their adverſaries; it is better to die then to live in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ſlavery, till ſuch time as an honourable and ſafe Peace may be treated and concluded.
